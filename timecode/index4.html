                    By examining the evolution of seasonal trends and the influence of holidays, we aim to uncover how different times of the year, from spring renewal to winter nostalgia, and holidays such as Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine's, shape cinematic themes and audience preferences. 
                    In this section, we explore these seasonal and holiday influences, delving into how they inspire filmmakers to craft narratives that resonate with the rhythms of the year.

              <p>Autumn and winter are popular seasons for movie releases, but each season brings unique trends in revenue, popularity, budget, and runtime. 
                For instance, while summer movies earn the most revenue, they are surprisingly the least common season for releases. These patterns raise intriguing 
                questions: Are summer movies typically blockbusters with bigger budgets? Does runtime or indie popularity vary across seasons? Dive into the insights 
                above to explore the fascinating connections between seasons and cinema.

              popularity throughout the year, offering a richer perspective on how audience preferences and seasonal timing influence cinematic success.

                  <p>We performed an OLS regression to examine how season affects movie revenue, using autumn as the reference season:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Spring movies show a $2.08M increase in revenue, but with a p-value of 0.166, this difference is not statistically significant.</li>
                    <li>Summer movies earn $5.2M more, with a p-value of 0.001, which is statistically significant, indicating higher revenue compared to autumn.</li>
                    <li>Winter movies earn $4.4M more, with a p-value of 0.004, also statistically significant.</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>However, the R-squared value of 0.002 shows that only 0.2% of the revenue variance is explained by the season, meaning other factors like budget likely play a bigger role.</p>

                  <p>For popularity, we again used autumn as the baseline season:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Spring movies have a -0.1056 coefficient, with a p-value of 0.033, indicating slightly lower popularity, which is statistically significant.</li>
                    <li>Summer movies show a small -0.05 coefficient with a p-value of 0.327, meaning the difference is not statistically significant.</li>
                    <li>Winter movies have a -0.56 coefficient and a p-value of 0.000, suggesting a significant drop in popularity.</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>The R-squared value of 0.004 means that season explains only 0.4% of the popularity variance, highlighting that factors like marketing and content quality are likely more influential.</p>

                <p>After reviewing how the season affects revenue and popularity, we would like to delve deeper into genres. Are certain genres more frequently released in certain seasons? 
                  To answer this, we’ll use t-statistics to test whether there’s a significant relationship between the season of release and the genre of movies.</p>
                <p>
                  T-statistics help us assess whether the differences we observe in our data are statistically significant or if they might have occurred by chance. In simple terms, it’s like
                  looking at a movie’s rough cut—t-statistics help us determine whether the trends we see are solid enough to make it into the final script or if they need more editing. 
                  By analyzing the t-statistic and p-value, we’ll uncover whether the season truly impacts which genres hit the screen most frequently.
                </p>
                <p class="markdown">T-statistic: 0.827878259701446, p-value: 0.4079757121240083</p>

            <div class="col-12">
              <p>Since the p-value is very small, we can conclude that the result is statistically significant. We have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is 
                  that there is no relationship between season and genre of the movie.</p>    
              <p>Do movies in some genres tend to perform better (have higher revenue and popularity) in certain seasons? We can look at the mean values for these variables:</p>

          <p>What can easily catch our eye is that Fantasy and Science fiction movies have way bigger average revenue in spring, comparing to other seasons. Why is that? Let’s test this hypothesis using t-statistics:</p> 
          <p class="markdown">T-statistic: 0.827878259701446, p-value: 0.4079757121240083</p> 
          <p>T-statistic (0.83): The T-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in your sample data. A value close to 0 indicates that there is 
            little difference between the two groups.</p>
          <p>p-value (0.41):The p-value tells us the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between the groups) were true. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject 
            the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, suggesting that the observed difference in revenue is not statistically significant. This means that while the trend is noticeable, the data doesn’t provide strong enough 
            evidence to confirm a significant impact of season on Fantasy and Science Fiction movie revenue.

              <p>The regression model we used aimed to explore how genres and seasons influence movie revenue, with an R-squared value of 0.028. This suggests that the model has weak explanatory power, meaning it only accounts for a small portion of the revenue variability.
                Despite this, the results highlighted a few key trends. The spring and summer seasons notably influenced revenue, particularly for genres like Family, Fantasy, and Adventure. The model also showed that Family and Fantasy genres generally enjoy higher revenues across seasons,
                while genres such as Horror, Drama, and Musical experienced some negative impacts during certain seasons. However, when looking at the interactions between genres and seasons—such as for Comedy, Crime, and Documentary—the effects were largely insignificant, 
                with p-values above the typical 0.05 threshold, suggesting no strong seasonal influence on these genres.</p>

              </ul>  
              <p>These are the questions we aim to answer.</p>
            </br>
            <h3 class="text-black">Context</h3>
            <p>We are analyzing the holidays of Christmas, Halloween, and Valentine's Day. During these holidays, the 
              atmosphere shifts, leading people to watch different Movie genres. For instance, during Christmas, audiences seek 
              comfort and typically favor feel-good, family-friendly movies. Halloween is an ideal time for horror films that thrill 
              viewers. And who wouldn’t want to watch a classic romantic movie to surprise their loved ones on Valentine’s Day? While these 
              assumptions seem logical, we intend to verify them using the available dataset.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-black">Assumptions</h3>
            <p>For our analysis, we focus on movies released after the 1950s, as this period provides a more consistent dataset, and these 
              holidays gained popularity over time. Additionally, we will concentrate on English-speaking movie countries, where these holidays 
              are most widely celebrated.
            </p>
          </br>
          <p>Let’s dive into the analysis! The plots below show the numer of released movies throughout months and years:</p>

          <p>Now, we can observe an increase in the number of Family movies released in December. To determine whether this difference is statistically significant, 
            we applied a hypothesis test to evaluate the extent of this seasonal trend.</p>
          <p class="markdown">Comparison of December with Month 1: p-value = 0.10604985194178361<br>

            Comparison of December with Month 11: p-value = 0.19559574896805798<br>
            December has significantly more family movie releases than  the following months: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
            </p>

            <p>From this, we can observe that December has significantly more family movie releases compared to other months outside the winter season. This makes sense, as the movie industry tends to 
              produce family-oriented films throughout the entire winter season, not just around Christmas.
            </p>

            <p>In the next section, we’ll explore the relationship between revenue and the number of family movies released in December.</p>

          <p>While revenue alone doesn’t provide us with much insight, we did notice a significant spike in the average number of family movies released in December, which strongly supports our initial assumption. 
            To dig deeper into this trend, we’re now turning to linear regression to explore whether there's a clear relationship between revenue and the number of movies released in December. 
            This will help us understand if the release month plays a role in shaping the financial success of family films during this time.</p>

          <p>In the first analysis, the p-value is greater than 0.5, indicating that the correlation between the release month and revenue is not statistically significant.

                    The countplot of horror movies shows a significant spike in October, which aligns perfectly with Halloween. This suggests that the horror genre experiences a surge in popularity during 
                    this time, likely due to the association with Halloween and people's tendency to seek out scary movies to match the spooky atmosphere of the holiday.

                in movie releases towards the end of the month as Halloween approaches, confirmed by a positive and statistically significant coefficient in the linear regression analysis. 
                Below, the plots illustrating these observations are displayed:</p>

            <p>For romantic movies around Valentine’s Day, we can anticipate a clear spike in movie releases and possibly revenue, 
              as romantic films are deeply tied to the celebration of love and relationships. With Valentine’s Day falling on February 14th, 
              it's the perfect time for these films to hit theaters, as couples seek out heartwarming stories to enjoy together. Let’s explore how 
              this special day drives both the number of releases and the potential for box office success.</p>

          <p>Despite our expectations, the t-test results reveal that February doesn’t stand out with a dramatic peak in romantic movie releases, at least not compared to most other months. 
            The only exception? September. When comparing February to September, we found a statistically significant difference, with a p-value of 0.0037, indicating that February does indeed 
            release more romantic films than September. However, when we compared February to the other months, the p-values were all well above the typical 0.05 threshold, suggesting that February’s 
            release pattern doesn’t significantly differ from most other months. This finding challenges the common assumption that Valentine’s Day leads to a clear surge in romantic film releases.</p>

            <p>As we suspected, February doesn’t emerge as the dominant month for romance movies, despite its strong association with Valentine’s Day. This finding hints at the possibility that other factors may 
              play a role in the timing of romantic movie releases, or perhaps the genre is more evenly distributed throughout the year rather than being concentrated around the holiday. It’s clear that the release 
              strategy for romance films is more complex than simply aligning with February’s festive mood.</p>

          <p>To evaluate whether the peak around the 22nd of February in average revenue is statistically significant, we can perform a t-test comparing the revenue on 
            that specific date with the revenue on other dates in February or across different months. The t-test will help us determine if the observed difference in 
            average revenue is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
          </p>

          <p class="markdown">Top 4 Days with Highest Average Revenue in Valentine's Week:<br>
            Comparison of Day 22 with Other Days: p-value = 0.0588095174464923<br>
            Comparison of Day 5 with Other Days: p-value = 0.5016367644056847<br>
            Comparison of Day 1 with Other Days: p-value = 0.2477609521288672<br>
            Comparison of Day 7 with Other Days: p-value = 0.1727987241041169<br>
            Revenue on the top days is not significantly higher than on other days.<br>
            </p>

            <p>It seems that, based on the data, romantic movies aren't as heavily concentrated around Valentine's Day as we might have expected. Despite the holiday's strong 
              association with romance, the data doesn’t show a clear spike in romantic movie releases or revenue during February. Perhaps it reflects changing trends in audience 
              preferences, where other genres (like action or comedy) may dominate even during traditionally romantic holidays.
            </p>

          <p>While romance might not be as prevalent in movies around Valentine’s, it doesn’t mean that romantic themes are dead—just that people might be seeking romance in 
            different forms or genres, such as romantic comedies or even within other genres. Or maybe it is just not concentrated around Valentine’s day, meaning that is always
             popular no matter what is the time of the year:&#41;.
