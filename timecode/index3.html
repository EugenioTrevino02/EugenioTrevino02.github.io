                    By diving into the evolution of film genres and themes, we tried to uncover how historical events have left marks on storytelling. In this section, 
                    we delve into four key historical moments: World War I, World War II, the Space Race, and the events of 9/11; exploring how they influenced the kinds 
                    of stories filmmakers chose to tell.

                <p>Seeing the data from our Dataset the earliest major historical event we could analyze was World War I. We wanted to see if the devastating doings of men and also the heroism of soldiers 
                    in World War I were captured on the big screen. Early war films often romanticized bravery, focusing on themes of patriotism and sacrifice. However, as the years passed, 
                    narratives became more introspective, grappling with the psychological scars left by war. We couldn’t establish a positive analysis to back up these statements but we dived 
                    deeper into why we weren't getting the desired results and by plotting the genres over time as well as the number of movies released by year we realized that there wasn’t enough 
                    data to make a robust analysis.

              <p>When we counted the number of movies made during major war periods, we found 1,500 films from 1914 to 1919, during World War I. For World War II, from 1939 to 1945, there were 2,892 movies, almost twice as many. This large difference means we have much more data to work with for World War II, which could lead to more useful results in our analysis.

                    <p>World War II solidified cinema's role as a powerful propaganda tool. Governments used film to rally support, inspire hope, and demonize enemies. 
                        Hollywood, in particular, became a hub for patriotic storytelling, producing classics such as Casablanca (1942) and The Great Dictator (1940). 
                        To see this projection over the war years we started by plotting the different genres comparing them to the Non-War period (1920-1938) and with 
                        the average of genres overall on our Dataset. For a broader perspective we plotted the amount of movies per genre (frequency) as well as the percentage 
                        each genre occupied with respect to all genres. We applied a log scale for better visualization.

                  <p>Analyzing the relationship between WWII and various genres reveals distinct trends. Crime movies saw a gradual rise leading up to WWII, with a noticeable peak right after the war ended. Although the percentage increase during WWII (4.19%) was modest compared to the entire dataset (4.03%), it still exceeded that of non-war periods (2.13%). Mystery movies showed a clearer connection, with production percentages significantly increasing during WWII (8.13%) compared to WWI (0.73%) and non-war periods (4.72%), supported by a strong correlation (~0.6), indicating the war period's influence on the genre. Similarly, documentaries experienced a spike during WWII (3.98%), higher than both WWI (0.47%) and non-war periods (1.11%), with a moderate correlation (0.5), highlighting the war's impact on this genre. Action movies exhibited a distinct surge during WWII (13.11%), surpassing both WWI (1.33%) and non-war periods (7.82%), although they eventually grew beyond WWII levels over time. Adventure movies followed a different pattern, maintaining high percentages during both war periods, with a significant share during WWII (8.13%) compared to WWI (2.67%) and non-war periods (7.20%), indicating a steady but notable connection to the war period. These trends underline WWII's varying degrees of influence on different film genres, shaping their production in unique ways.

                    <p>The mid-20th century brought tension all over the world, with the Space Race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and with it, brought a surge in science fiction films. Movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977) reflected society's fascination with the possibilities of space exploration. Because of this, we concentrated on the genre of Sci-Fi in this case.
                    </p> 
                    <p>On the following graph, the rise of Sci-Fi movies over the Cold War period can be displayed, which confirms our hypothesis. </p>

Below we show the graph with the analysis in the US as well as a plot of the amount of movies from the USSR to prove the point of having little data. We can see that the increment in Sci.Fi movies from the US is similar to the overall behavior of this genre. This once again is because the US is the country with most movie releases in the dataset.

                    <p>To analyze the behavior of Sci-Fi movies during the space race, we employed linear regression to quantify the trend in their production. 
                        Linear regression is a valuable tool for this analysis as it helps identify and measure the rate of change over time, providing a clearer 
                        understanding of whether the space race had a noticeable impact on the genre. By focusing on the period immediately preceding the space race 
                        and its early years (1943–1959), we aimed to capture how external events might have influenced the Sci-Fi genre. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>The regression analysis produced a slope of approximately 0.36, indicating a steady upward trend in the production of Sci-Fi movies during this period. 
                        This positive slope suggests that as interest in space exploration grew, so did the prevalence of Sci-Fi films, reflecting how cultural and scientific 
                        developments likely influenced the genre. The regression results allow us to draw a more precise connection between the space race and the evolution of Sci-Fi cinema, 
                        highlighting the importance of quantitative methods in understanding historical influences on film. </p>

              <p>For the next analysis, we chose to focus on the event of 9/11, a significant historical moment that has inspired numerous films and documentaries. 
                Given its profound impact, we will concentrate specifically on the documentary genre.

                            For example, during World War I, there was a notable shift in sentiment, with a significant decrease in sentiment from before to during the war. 
                            World War II saw a further decline in sentiment, with significant changes before, during, and after the war. The sentiment scores for WWII show that 
                            before the war, sentiment was slightly negative, but it dropped sharply during and even further after the war, with statistically significant changes in 
                            sentiment across all periods.

                        <p>Our analysis of these historical periods shows how filmmakers adapt their stories to reflect the sentiments, fears, and aspirations of the times. 
                            By looking at trends in genre distribution and thematic focus, we identify clear patterns of how cinema evolves in response to global events, providing 
                            audiences with both a means to process reality and a way to dream of brighter futures.
